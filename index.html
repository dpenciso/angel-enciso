      <h1>About Angel Enciso</h1>
      <p>
        Angel Enciso was born and raised in the South American country of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" target="blank">Peru</a>
        where he and his 9 siblings learned that with a hard work ethic, and
        faith, nothing is impossible. His father, Jesus, worked for the
        ministry of education in Lima and his mother worked raising and feeding 10
        children. Angel attributes all he has to his loving parents, whose
        sacrifice paved the way for their children to go on and live prosperous
        lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Angel grew up with a love and passion for soccer. He and his brothers
        would sneak away from home any chance they got to go and play with
        frineds out in the streets, even with the risk of being caught and
        chased by their broom-wielding mother. Angel had a bright athletic
        future ahead of him, but decided to put it on hold to serve and LDS
        mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        After his mission, Angel went to live in Sao Paulo, Brazil to puruse his
        dream of playing professional soccer. Brazil had such an impact on him,
        that when asked where he is from, Angel responds:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>"Made in Peru, but assembled in Brazil."</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Not only did Angel's skill and love of soccer grow in Brazil, but in
        order to make ends meet he began working as a painter. His mentor was a
        German immigrant named Wenzel Pfeiffer who taught him that quality work
        is the only kind of work that is worth doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        After living in Brazil for five years, Angel finally got engaged to the
        love of his life, an American named Becky Pelo. He decided to retun home
        to Peru and get married in the Lima, Peru LDS temple. After living in
        Peru for 1 year after getting married, Angel and Becky decided it was
        time to move to the United States and begin life there. They currently
        reside in Orem, UT where Angel continues painting and also manages his
        own youth soccer club.
